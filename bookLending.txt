  Hello! I am Maria Hernandez

Q: How often do you borrow or lend books to friends or classmates?
A: Not very often, actually. I mostly buy my own books, especially since I'm always looking for specific fantasy novels. Occasionally a friend will borrow one of mine, but it's rare. I guess a platform like this would make it easier to find books I want to read without buying them all.

Q: Can you describe your typical process for finding new books to read? Where do you usually look?
A: I usually browse the shelves at the bookstore where I work – it's a great perk! I also check out online reviews and recommendations on Goodreads, mostly looking for fantasy and fiction. Sometimes I'll ask friends for suggestions too, especially if they know I'm looking for something specific.

Q: Have you ever had a negative experience borrowing or lending books to someone? If so, what happened?
A: Um, yeah, actually. I lent a really old copy of *The Name of the Wind* to a friend last semester, and she… well, let’s just say it took a lot longer than we agreed to get it back, and it came back a little… worse for wear. It was pretty frustrating, especially since it was a special edition. It made me a bit hesitant to lend out books since then.

Q: What are your biggest frustrations when it comes to managing your reading list and borrowing/lending books?
A: Hmm, that's a good question. I guess my biggest frustration is keeping track of everything – what I want to read next, what I've borrowed, and when it's due back. Sometimes I lose track and feel bad if a book is overdue. It would be much easier if there was a system to help manage all that.

Q: What aspects of borrowing or lending books cause you the most inconvenience or stress?
A: Hmm, that's a good question. I guess the biggest inconvenience is just coordinating schedules with someone to pick up and drop off the book. Finding a time that works for both of us can be tricky, especially since my part-time job hours are pretty unpredictable. It would be nice if there was a simpler way to manage that.

Q: Do you currently use any other platforms or methods for borrowing or lending books? If so, what are they and what are their pros and cons?
A: Um, not really. I sometimes borrow books from friends, but it's pretty informal. The main problem is remembering who has what and when it's due back – it's a bit chaotic. A more organized system would definitely be helpful.

What features would be essential for a book-sharing platform to be successful in your opinion 3. Imagine you're designing the messaging system for this platform. What features would you include to ensure secure and efficient communication between borrowers and lenders, 4. Let's say you could add one unique feature to a book-sharing platform that doesn't currently exist. What would it be and why???
A: Hmm, I haven't actually used a book-sharing app before. I mostly just borrow from friends or the library. But a platform like that sounds really convenient, especially if it had a good search function. For it to be successful, I think it needs easy searching by genre and author, definitely. And a rating/review system would be great – I always check those before buying a book. Plus, a way to easily see who's nearby would be helpful. If I were designing the messaging system, I'd want it to be private, like end-to-end encrypted, so our conversations stay between the borrower and lender. Maybe even a way to schedule reminders about due dates within the messages. As for a unique feature… that’s a tough one. Maybe some kind of built-in book recommendation system based on your borrowing history and ratings? It could help people discover new books they might like, which is always fun.
